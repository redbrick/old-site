Setting this up:

 * Install Django 1.1.1 on whatever dev machine you're using.
 * Copy rbsite/settings.py-dist to rbsite/settings.py
   - This is by default set to expect the HG repo to be checked out to a
	  folder called "sitev8" into your home directory.
	- It will create a SQLite database called rbsite.db in your home 
	  directory when you run syncdb.
	- hgignore is set to ignore this file, so if you want permanent changes,
	  add them to the settings.py-dist file instead.
 * Run rbsite/manage.py syncdb to create ~/rbsite.db and fill in your
   local admin details.

Some notes:
 * The RSS reader plugin (rssplug.py) needs feedparser to be installed.
